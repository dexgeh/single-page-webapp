single-page-webapp
==================

This project show a single page web applcation architecture,
realized using nodejs stack.

The server side is coded in coffee-script and built around express and its
router; it will render a static page in which a dynamic javascript bootstrap
data can be injected to initialize the application state.

Client javascript code is generated by coffee-script sources, piped into the
React jsx compiler. Css files are compiled from stylus sources.

The page rendering happens client-side, using page.js as dispatcher and React.

Running the webapp
------------------

Run ```npm install``` to get server-side dependencies (console-ten,
coffee-script, react-tools, express, stylus), and ```bower install```
for the client side dependencies.

If you don't have ```bower``` installed on your system run the script in
```node_modules``` folder,  ```./node_modules/bower/bin/bower install```.

Start the server with ```npm start```, and ```npm stop``` to stop the server.

By default it will run on the 8080 port, see ```server/index.coffee```.
